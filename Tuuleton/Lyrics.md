A bird-themed story where Windless is an almost flightless bird. He groans when he flies, but it’s not good to be on the ground either. He mourns his inability to fly like the others and is bitter because he is not accepted by the others just because he’s different. Winter is coming and when the nightly frosts arrive it becomes increasingly difficult to survive in the cold ground.

The Windless doesn’t touch these trees,
its crying has covered all the ground.
The Windless could be the silent one,
but noticed when travels above.
Sits silent, the frost rests on the face,
when the morning is born behind the dark.

Every one of us ends up in its own place,
the frozen ones don’t travel alone over the head.
The silent cranes arrive to the island,
and survivors of ice join to the wedge of cranes.
The head falls, and the ferry of one who surrenders gliding,
the shine of ice shimmer like through the sky.

Steps as ailing over the moss – The Windless.
The roots freezes trees in eternal rivers.
The longing doesn’t row against, sits next to:
in longing my echo is louder.

Because of descending life,
the winter road of throstles would pass over me!
The silent Windless is on the snow!

It feels like all the ground is going overhead,
they didn’t take me with them.
I stay with silently disappearing wind,
the journeys of wings go over us.
The shadows are like lights over the laps of the dark ground,
the lights are like strangers’ footsteps.
The nocturnal are like days over the day less villages,
under me my cold feet are frozen on the ice.

Steps as ailing over the moss – The Windless.
The river’s ferry freezes the foot bones.
The longing doesn’t row against, sits next to:
in longing my echo is louder.

Because of descending life,
the winter road of throstles would pass over me!
I see the throstles’ journeys from my ice.
The winter road would pass over me!
The silent Windless is on the snow!
