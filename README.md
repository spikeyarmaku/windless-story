# Windless story
This is a short story based on the song [Tuuleton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qysLqljaREs) from the finnish folk metal band [Korpiklaani](https://korpiklaani.com/).

From their [page for Tuuleton](https://korpiklaani.com/?p=958):

### The meaning of Tuuleton (“The Windless”):
*“A bird-themed story where Windless is an almost flightless bird. He groans when he flies, but it’s not good to be on the ground either. He mourns his inability to fly like the others and is bitter because he is not accepted by the others just because he’s different. Winter is coming and when the nightly frosts arrive it becomes increasingly difficult to survive in the cold ground.”*

This song has inspired me to do a quick project, telling the story of a [Kagu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagu), a nearly flightless bird, who wants to follow the crowd of birds flying to warmer places as winter gets closer and closer.

I decided to do it under a week, as a kind of game jam. I transcribed the music as much as I could, using a free trial version of [RipX DeepRemix](https://hitnmix.com/download_deepremix/) 5.2.6 to isolate instruments and vocals, [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm) (my DAW of choice) 6.58, and [Vital](https://vital.audio/) 1.0.4 - a free software sound synth. The transcription is not very accurate, but it serves its purpose - it can be found in the `Tuuleton_tab` directory. Images were made with [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net) 4.3.11.

Since I wanted to do this project in a short amount of time, I settled for a pixel art style, which paired well with the slightly 8-bit-ish sound I created. I used the [Godot](godotengine.org/) game engine (v3.4.4) to create the game, since it is small, and has good 2D support for games using pixel-art. Every asset was made by me, and is unlicensed.

The code is bad. I wanted to finish quickly, so there is almost no structure to it, it's full of hacks, and bad practices. Don't use it as a teaching / learning resource.
